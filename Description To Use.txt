Dear Fitpeo Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I have completed the assessment for the automation tester position. Below are the details for setting up and running my automation script:

Development Environment:

IDE: Eclipse
Project Type: Maven

Setup Instructions:

Download the provided source code files.
Open Eclipse IDE.
Import the Maven project into Eclipse:
Go to File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects.
Browse to the directory where you downloaded the source code files and select it.
Complete the import process.
Ensure that the necessary dependencies (such as selenium-java) are downloaded automatically by Maven.

I apologize for the delay in submitting this assessment. The email mentioned a deadline of August 3, 2024, but I only saw the email this morning. I appreciate your understanding and consideration.

Thank you for the opportunity.
